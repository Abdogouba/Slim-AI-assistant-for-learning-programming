This is my bachelor thesis project as a computer science and engineering (MET) student at the German University in Cairo (GUC) under the supervision of Dr Tamer Mostafa (Ain Shams University).
It is a Java prompt engineering app for learning programming, it is the same as ChatGPT (I used their api) but I added a prompt engineering layer.
The prompt engineering layer is simply some short questions I ask the user to collect the information I want; so that I can compile the best possible prompt (based on the prompt engineering principles) and pass it to the api, the prompt engineering layer is highly customised to our topic: learning programming.
The questions are also customised based on what assistance the user wants from ChatGPT (examples: generate study plans, fix errors, or explain coding concepts).
